                        <h1>Herbivore Garden Centre</h1>
                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                                <p>I worked at Herbivore Garden Centre for about 6 months, learning about organic farming, indoor plants and running the online sales and inventory for the business.
                                    Despite it being only a year old, Herbivore had earned its reputation as a source of quality garden products and accessories, as well as a reference point for any organic farming questions.
                                    Having developed an appreciation for what it takes to run a successful plant-based enterprised, I came up with a proposal for the Herbivore Garden Centre rebrand.</p>
                            <h2>Objectives</h2>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Promote new and available products.</li>
                                    <li>Streamline visual identity across platforms.</li>
                                    <li>Incorporate partnerships.</li>
                                    <li>Engage the online audience</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h2>Visual Identity</h2>
                                <p>The brand has relied heavily on the logo as its main identifier. However as the store diversified its services and products, bringing other known partners in the field in, there was a need to develop clear branding and marketing collateral. The rebrand needed to portray authority, versatility with the coming expansions and a commitment to small-space farmers and sustainability practices.</p>
                            <h2>Customer Persona</h2>
                                <p>The user, in this case, would have to be split between the different stores i.e. digital vs physical. The general audience is primarily female, aged between 25 and 40, mostly enthusiasts and small-space gardeners.</p>
                            <h2>Products & Services</h2>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Plants and Garden Accessories</li>
                                    <li>Information and Consultation</li>
                                    <li>Landscaping and Permaculture Design</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h2>Platforms</h2>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Social media</li>
                                    <li>Email</li>
                                    <li>Website</li>
                                    <li>Print</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Social Media</h3>
                                    <p>Facebook and Instagram were the primary market, requiring short-form content that is primarily visual. The posts need to be colourful, respecting the branding guidelines, and always paired with a clear call-to-action to drive sales.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Promote products</li>
                                        <li>Inform and engage the audience</li>
                                    </ul>
